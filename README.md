SDEV140 - Genshin Pity System - Final Project
  This final project consists of code that will be used to create a GUI application with Tkinter. I will be using the video game 'Genshin Impactâ€™s "pity system" 
in my program. The pity system is also known as the 50/50 pity. In Genshin, there are 5-star standard characters, 5-star banner characters, and 4-star characters. 
4-star characters will not be included in this program (but they can be obtained when "pulling" or "wishing" for 5-star banner characters).
  When a player obtains a 5-star character, their wishes will reset, and they will have a 0.6% chance to obtain another 5-star character before the 75th pull.
When the user pulls 75 times, they enter a soft pity. The chances of getting a 5-star character increase with each wish, up to 90 wishes.
On the 90th wish, there is a 100% chance the user will obtain a 5-star character. However, the 50/50 pity states that the player has a 50% chance to 
get a standard character or a 50% chance in receiving a banner character. If a player "loses" the pity and receives a standard 5-star character, 
they have a 100% chance in obtaining the banner character in the next 90 pulls. If a player "wins" the pity and receives a banner character, 
they are still in the pity for the next 90 wishes.
